# SARS_CoV_2_article_scraping
A workflow to pull articles weekly from Google Scholar about the SARS_CoV_2 pandemic. 

![Google Scholar Search Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus and COVID-19](https://github.com/acapria/SARS_CoV_2_article_scraping/assets/131828886/ab974805-7fb0-4cfd-a114-2bb91ab2a794)



This workflow was created to reduce the burden of flipping through google scholar pages for articles about SARS-CoV-2

## Octoparse
This workflow starts with google scholar then uses octoparse to read through the google scholar page and pull the data. This workflow is stored in the OTD file.

Octoparse Scraping Pipeline


## File Manipulation
Then the outputted CSV from octoparse is running the python script #scraper for SARS_CoV_2 Articles.py

## Test Files
As you can see there are 3 different outputs.

|Output | File name |
|------|-------|
|Subset of outputs of publications from high impact journal list|high_impact_journals|
|Publications which have the keywords from the table below annotated | keyword_rows|
|Both of the above parameters| highimpact_and_keyword|

<sup> *each output has the data from the pull attached to it
