# SARS_CoV_2_article_scraping
A workflow to pull articles weekly from Google Scholar about the SARS_CoV_2 pandemic. 

![Google Scholar Search Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus and COVID-19](https://github.com/acapria/SARS_CoV_2_article_scraping/assets/131828886/ab9973de-0122-487f-b5fc-d718101322a4)



This workflow was created to reduce the burden of flipping through google scholar pages for articles about SARS-CoV-2

## Octoparse
This workflow starts with google scholar then uses octoparse to read through the google scholar page and pull the data. 

## File Manipulation
Then the outputted CSV from octoparse is running the python script #scraper for SARS_CoV_2 Articles.py

## Test Files
As you can see there are 3 different outputs
